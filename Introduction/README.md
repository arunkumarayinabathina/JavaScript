### ✅ 1. What is JavaScript?

**Answer:**
JavaScript is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, **dynamically typed**, and **multi-paradigm scripting language** primarily used to create interactive web applications.

It was initially designed for **client-side scripting**, but now it’s used for:

* **Server-side development** (Node.js)
* **Mobile apps** (React Native, Ionic)
* **Desktop apps** (Electron.js)
* **Game development** (Phaser, Three.js)
* **IoT and Machine Learning**

> "JavaScript allows developers to build full-stack applications using the same language on both client and server sides."

### ✅ 2. Why is JavaScript important?

**Answer:**

* Powers over **95% of websites**
* Used by top companies like **Google, Netflix, LinkedIn, Facebook, Uber**
* Supported natively by all browsers
* Huge ecosystem (npm, libraries, frameworks)
* Enables full-stack development (React + Node.js)

---

### ✅ 3. What are the features of JavaScript?

**Answer:**

* Interpreted (not compiled)
* High-level and dynamic
* Prototype-based OOP
* Supports event-driven and functional programming
* Runs in browsers and server environments (like Node.js)

---

### ✅ 4. Who created JavaScript and when?

**Answer:**

* **Brendan Eich** created JavaScript in **1995** while working at Netscape.
* It was created in just **10 days**.

---

### ✅ 5. What were the earlier names of JavaScript?

**Answer:**

* Originally called **Mocha**
* Renamed to **LiveScript**
* Finally named **JavaScript** (for marketing, to ride on Java’s popularity)

---

### ✅ 6. Where was JavaScript first implemented?

**Answer:**
JavaScript was first implemented in **Netscape Navigator 2.0**.

---

### ✅ 7. What is Microsoft’s JScript?

**Answer:**
**JScript** was Microsoft’s reverse-engineered version of JavaScript for **Internet Explorer**, leading to inconsistencies in early web development.

---

### ✅ 8. Why was ECMAScript created?

**Answer:**
To avoid fragmentation, JavaScript was standardized in **1997** by **ECMA International**, under the name **ECMAScript (ES)**.

---

### ✅ 9. What is ECMAScript?

**Answer:**
ECMAScript is the **official standard** for JavaScript defined by **ECMA International** (specifically the **TC39 Committee**).

* **JavaScript** is the language.
* **ECMAScript** is the specification.

### ✅ 10. What are the major ECMAScript versions?

**Answer:**

| Version      | Year    | Key Features                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ES5          | 2009    | Strict mode, Array methods, JSON support                                       |
| ES6 (ES2015) | 2015    | `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes, promises, modules, template literals |
| ESNext       | Ongoing | Refers to the most recent or upcoming ECMAScript proposals and updates         |

### ✅ 11. What is a JavaScript engine?

**Answer:**
A **JavaScript engine** is a program that parses, interprets, and executes JavaScript code.

Different browsers use different engines:

| Engine             | Browser / Platform      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **V8**             | Google Chrome, Node.js  |
| **SpiderMonkey**   | Mozilla Firefox         |
| **JavaScriptCore** | Apple Safari            |
| **Chakra**         | Microsoft Edge (legacy) |

---

### ✅ 12. What is the V8 Engine?

**Answer:**

* V8 is Google’s high-performance **JavaScript engine** written in **C++**.
* Used in **Google Chrome** and **Node.js**.
* It uses **JIT (Just-In-Time)** compilation to convert JS into machine code.
* V8 is open-source.

> "V8 enabled JavaScript to perform efficiently in browsers and on servers via Node.js."

---

### ✅ 13. What is Node.js?

**Answer:**

* Node.js is **not a language or a framework**.
* It is a **JavaScript runtime environment** that runs JS code **outside the browser**, built on **V8 Engine**.
* Enables building **scalable server-side applications**.
* Supports **event-driven**, **non-blocking I/O**, ideal for real-time systems.

---

### ✅ 14. What makes Node.js different?

**Answer:**

* Executes JavaScript outside browsers
* Handles thousands of connections using **non-blocking asynchronous I/O**
* Uses a **single-threaded event loop**
* Suitable for REST APIs, microservices, real-time apps like chat

---

### ✅ 15. Summary – Why is JavaScript so dominant today?

**Answer:**

> "JavaScript started as a simple scripting language for web pages, but with ECMAScript standardization, V8 engine performance, and environments like Node.js, it evolved into a full-stack, universal programming language for the web, mobile, desktop, and more."
